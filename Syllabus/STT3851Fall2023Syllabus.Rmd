**Course Text:**

[_An Introdution to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani

**Optional References:**

[_Reproducible Research with R and RStudio, Second Edition_](https://github.com/christophergandrud/Rep-Res-Book) by Christopher Gandrud

[_The Elements of Statistical Learning_](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman

[_R Graphics Cookbook_](http://www.amazon.com/R-Graphics-Cookbook-Winston-Chang/dp/1449316956) by Winston Chang - Available via `SafariBooksOnline` through the Appalachian State University [library](http://library.appstate.edu/). 


**Course Grading:**


* 30% of the course grade will come from quizzes and homework (8).
* 15% of the grade will come from labs (3).
* 25% of the grade will come from projects (2).
* 25% of the grade will come from the Mid-Exams (2).
* 05% of the course grade will come from participation (attendance, participation in discussion in-class).

*Attendance and participation:* As we are trying to make this experience as close to a regular class as possible, interactivity is important. Therefore you are required have your video on and actively participate in all the class discussions. Attendance will be taken at the end of each class. Students are expected to attend every class. A detailed description of the ASU attendance policy can be found at the following link, [https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information]

*Quizzes:* I anticipate giving in class quizzes regularly during the semester. As the final quizzes need to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during quiz time.

*Tests:* Two tests will be given. The date of each test will be announced at least one week in advance. As the exams need to be proctored you are required to have your video camera on during the exam time.


<!--* ...Up to 10 points may be added to your final course average for an excellent compilation of all assignments (quizzes, labs, projects) and class notes in a single hyperlinked `*.html` document.

**Piazza:**

This term we will be using Piazza for class discussion. The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates and myself. Rather than emailing questions to the teaching staff, I encourage you to post your questions on Piazza. If you have any problems or feedback for the developers, email team@piazza.com.

**How To Get Unstuck**

If you have a course related question, please ask your question on [piazza](piazza.com/appstate/spring2018/stat3851/home).  Your classmates may have the same question or may answer your question before I can provide an answer.  Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.
