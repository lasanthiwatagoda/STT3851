1. What are the main two statistical learning types?

2. State two examples where you can use the two types you mentioned in question 1). Explain **why** for each example. 


3. Supervised Learning has been broadly classified into 2 types. What are they?



4. State three examples where you can use **regression**, **classification** and **clustering**. Explain **why** for each example. 
 

5. Use the `Auto` data set found in the `ISLR` library to create the scatter plot shown here for `weight` versus `mpg` for each `origin`.
  

  
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
library(ggplot2)
data(Auto)


ggplot(data = Auto, aes(x=weight, y=mpg, color= factor(origin))) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE) + theme_bw()

```
